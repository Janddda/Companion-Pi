# APMpi 2/3/Zero.img V1_0 by Benbojangles (06/05/2016)
- This .img file is V1 of a project I am working on. It is available under creative Commons License.

- This .img file is a custom raspbian image created for the Raspberry pi, it includes:
- Raspbian Jessie
- Gstreamer
- Mavproxy
- SSH Enabled
- Pi Camera enabled
- Disabled O/S control of Serial port
- Custom config.txt for performance
- Static IP enabled

# How to burn to SD card:
- 1)Burn .img to sd card using win32diskimager.exe
- 2)Boot pi 2/3/Zero
- 3)Connect to your wifi network to aquire ip address
- 4)Shutdown pi 2/3/Zero and unplug keyboard/mouse/screen, restart pi 2/3/Zero
- 4)SSH connect: 192.168.1.3 port:22 - username:pi password:raspberry 
- 5)run mavproxy & gstreamer with settings as you wish (or use my settings)


- I hope to add more features in future once the groundpi 2/3/Zero is complete, there will not be a need to setup IP.

- Thanks, suggestions/future .img versions to i6mods@gmail.com
