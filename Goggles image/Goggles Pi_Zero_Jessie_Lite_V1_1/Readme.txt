# Goggles_Pi_Zero_Jessie_Lite_V1_1 - Tested on Pi Zero V1.3 - Also (probably) working for pi2/3 by Benbojangles (27/05/2016)
- This .img file is a project I am working on. It is available under creative Commons License.

- This .img file is a custom raspbian image created for the Raspberry pi Zero, it includes:
- Raspbian Jessie Lite (version from 01/11/2016)
- Gstreamer
- Mavproxy
- SSH Enabled
- Pi Camera enabled
- Disabled O/S control of Serial port
- Custom config.txt for performance
- Static IP enabled

File fits on 2gb sd card. Also fits on larger sd card (you can expand filesystem if wish to)

# How to burn to SD card:
- 1)Burn .img to sd card using win32diskimager.exe
- 2)Power ON pi Zero
- 3)Video displays with HDMI goggles


- I hope to add more features in future once the groundpi 2/3/Zero is complete, there will not be a need to setup IP.

- Thanks, suggestions/future .img versions to i6mods@gmail.com
