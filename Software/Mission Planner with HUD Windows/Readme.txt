- This is an adapted Mission Planner software for Windows devices allowing video display.

- It will allow you to experiment with video transmission & APM data.

- More info & how to run here:

- My notes:
- This is more simple to use and straightforward to use. 
- It could be tweaked to allow drop-down menu for different video ratios over UDP 
- Also would be nice to have an option to dock the video picture into the normal Mission Planner HUD.
